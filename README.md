  Python
  The lesson plans in which I teach middle school kids how to program with Python
  Each week pertains to a new lesson in which arrays, functions, dictionaries, and lists were used extensively.
  The overall goal of the class is to teach the students the importance of Python, avoid syntax errors, and understand
  how to use these key fundamentals when programming with Python to prepare them for Advanced Design with Python.
